# GraphRAG System Improvements Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines improvements to enhance your GraphRAG system for better document understanding and question answering capabilities.

## Current Setup Analysis
✅ **Working Well:**
- PDF loading and chunking
- Neo4j graph database setup
- LLM integration with custom Cypher prompts
- Basic graph document conversion

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
- Dependency issues causing execution errors
- Limited entity extraction specificity
- Single retrieval method (only Cypher-based)
- No evaluation framework

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Dependencies**
- Fixed `python-dotenv` import issue
- Added numpy and pandas for better data handling
- Updated requirements.txt with proper versions

### 2. **Improved Graph Extraction**
- **Semantic Chunking**: Better chunk boundaries for entity preservation
- **Domain-Specific Entity Types**: Focused on GODOT-specific concepts
- **Custom Relationships**: Tailored relationship types for stakeholder models

### 3. **Hybrid Retrieval System**
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity for relevant document chunks
- **Graph Traversal**: Entity-based navigation for connected information
- **Combined Context**: Merge both approaches for comprehensive answers

### 4. **Better Cypher Generation**
- **Enhanced Prompts**: More specific prompts for GODOT domain
- **Schema-Aware**: Uses actual graph schema for query generation
- **Context Expansion**: OPTIONAL MATCH for broader information retrieval

### 5. **Evaluation Framework**
- **Multiple Methods**: Compare Cypher vs Hybrid approaches
- **Test Questions**: Predefined questions for consistent evaluation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and debugging information

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Notebook Cells in Order
1. Import libraries and setup
2. Load environment variables
3. Process your PDF document
4. Extract graph with improved transformer
5. Test the comprehensive Q&A system

### Step 3: Evaluate Performance
Use the test questions to compare different retrieval methods:
- "What are the incentives for employees?"
- "How does the equity trust work?"
- "What is game theory in the context of GODOT?"

## Advanced Optimizations (Future)

### 1. **Graph Post-Processing**
- Entity resolution and deduplication
- Relationship refinement
- Community detection for topic clustering

### 2. **Retrieval Optimization**
- Learned sparse retrievers
- Re-ranking models
- Query expansion techniques

### 3. **Answer Quality Improvements**
- Multi-hop reasoning chains
- Confidence scoring
- Source attribution and citations

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
- Response time metrics
- Answer relevance scoring
- User feedback integration

## Best Practices

1. **Document Preparation**
   - Clean PDF formatting
   - Consistent terminology
   - Clear section headings

2. **Graph Design**
   - Domain-specific entity types
   - Meaningful relationship labels
   - Rich node properties

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Use indexes for frequently queried properties
   - Limit result sets appropriately
   - Profile query performance

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test suites
   - Compare multiple retrieval methods
   - Validate against ground truth

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dependency Errors
- Ensure all packages are installed with correct versions
- Restart notebook kernel after package installation

### Graph Connection Issues
- Verify Neo4j credentials in .env file
- Check Neo4j service is running
- Test connection before graph operations

### Poor Answer Quality
- Inspect extracted entities and relationships
- Refine chunking strategy
- Adjust LLM prompts for better extraction

### Performance Issues
- Monitor graph database size
- Add appropriate indexes
- Consider pagination for large result sets

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure improvement:
- **Answer Accuracy**: How well answers match expected information
- **Response Time**: Speed of answer generation
- **Coverage**: Percentage of questions that receive answers
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on answer quality and relevance
